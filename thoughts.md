I am committed to calendaring! I'm a decent time-manager, but I can already see how overwhelming this could all be without the aide of a well-put-together calendar.
I am committed to looking at the lessons BEFORE they happen. I have never done this before. I've already started with Mod 0, and it makes so much more sense! I will continue to do this throughout my time at Turing.
